# Java Mobile Phone Collection
This simple application can be used to manage phone collection. You can add phone (producer, model, android version and web site), update phone by clicking on phone you want to update, delete phone by swiping a finger from left to right or inversaly, visit producer web site by clicking on properly button. As a user you can see all phones added to database and clear them all. Hope my screenshots explain how it works.
I am writting this application on my IT class.
