# Java Mobile Phone Collection
This simple application can be used to manage phone collection. It isn't completed yet. You can add phone (producer and model) but as a coder not a user. As a user you can see all phones added to database and clear them all. More functionality is going to be added later.
I am writting this application on my IT class.
